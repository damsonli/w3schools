<h3>CSS Units</h3>
<p>CSS has several different units for expressing a length.</p>
<p>Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, 
  border-width, etc.</p>
<p>Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.</p>
<p>A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit 
  can be omitted.</p>
<p>For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.</p>
<p></p>There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Absolute Lengths</h3>
<p>The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly 
  that size.</p>
<p>Absolute length units are not recommneded for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. 
  However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.</p>

<p>* Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel 
  (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device 
  pixels.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Relative Lengths</h3>
<p>Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units 
  scales better between different rendering mediums.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!</p>
<p>* Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.</p>
<hr />

<h3>Browser Support</h3>
<p>The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the length unit.</p>
