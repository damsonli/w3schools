<h3>CSS Counters</h3>
<p>CSS counters are "variables" maintained by CSS whose values can be incremented by CSS rules (to 
  track how many times they are used). Counters let you adjust the appearance of content based on 
  its placement in the document.</p>

<h3>Automatic Numbering With Counters</h3>
<p>CSS counters are like "variables". The variable values can be incremented by CSS rules 
  (which will track how many times they are used).</p>
<p>To work with CSS counters we will use the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>counter-reset: Creates or resets a counter</li>
  <li>counter-increment: Increments a counter value</li>
  <li>content: Inserts generated content</li>
  <li>counter() or counters() function: Adds the value of a counter to an element</li>
</ul>

<p>To use a CSS counter, it must first be created with counter-reset.</p>
<p>The following example creates a counter for the page (in the body selector), then increments the 
  counter value for each &lt;h2&gt; element and adds "Section &lt;value of the counter&gt;:" to the 
  beginning of each &lt;h2&gt; element:</p>

body {

}

h2::before {
  counter-increment: section;
  content: "Section " counter(section) ": ";
}
</pre>
<hr />

<h3>Nesting Counters</h3>
<p>The following example creates one counter for the page (section) and one counter for each 
  &lt;h1&gt; element (subsection). The "section" counter will be counted for each &lt;h1&gt; element 
  with "Section &lt;value of the section counter&gt;.", and the "subsection" counter will be counted 
  for each &lt;h2&gt; element with "&lt;value of the section counter&gt;.&lt;value of the subsection 
  counter&gt;":</p>


<pre>
body {
  counter-reset: section;
}

h1 {
  counter-reset: subsection;
}

h1::before {
  counter-increment: section;
  content: "Section " counter(section) ". ";
}

h2::before {
  counter-increment: subsection;
  content: counter(section) "." counter(subsection) " ";
}
</pre>

<p>A counter can also be useful to make outlined lists because a new instance of a counter is 
  automatically created in child elements. Here we use the counters() function to insert a string 
  between different levels of nested counters:</p>

<pre>
ol {
  counter-reset: section;
  list-style-type: none;
}

li::before {
  counter-increment: section;
  content: counters(section,".") " ";
}
</pre>
