<h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
<p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display 
    for different devices and screen sizes.</p>

<h3>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h3>
<p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p>
<p>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:</p>
<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a 
    nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were 
    added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
<p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

<h3>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h3>
<p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
<p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
