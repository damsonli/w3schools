<h3>What is a Web Worker?</h3>
<p>When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.</p>
<p>A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without 
    affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting 
    things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>Count numbers: <output id="result"></output></p>
<button onclick="startWorker()">Start Worker</button> 
<button onclick="stopWorker()">Stop Worker</button>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions do not support Web Workers.</p>

<script>
var w;

function startWorker() {
    if(typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
        if(typeof(w) == "undefined") {
            w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
        }
        w.onmessage = function(event) {
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = event.data;
        };
    } else {
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Sorry, your browser does not support Web Workers...";
    }
}

function stopWorker() { 
    w.terminate();
    w = undefined;
}
</script>

<h3>Check Web Worker Support</h3>
<p>Before creating a web worker, check whether the user's browser supports it:</p>
<pre>
if (typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
  // Yes! Web worker support!
  // Some code.....
} else {
  // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
}
</pre>

<h3>Create a Web Worker File</h3>
<p>Now, let's create our web worker in an external JavaScript.</p>
<p>Here, we create a script that counts. The script is stored in the "demo_workers.js" file:</p>
<pre>
var i = 0;

function timedCount() {
    i = i + 1;
    postMessage(i);
    setTimeout("timedCount()",500);
}

timedCount(); 
</pre>

<p>The important part of the code above is the postMessage() method - which is used 
    to post a message back to the HTML page.</p>
<p>Note: Normally web workers are not used for such simple scripts, but for more CPU intensive tasks.</p>

<h3>Create a Web Worker Object</h3>
<p>Now that we have the web worker file, we need to call it from an HTML page.</p>
<p>The following lines checks if the worker already exists, if not - it creates a new 
    web worker object and runs the code in "demo_workers.js":</p>
<pre>
if (typeof(w) == "undefined") {
  w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
}
</pre>

<p>Then we can send and receive messages from the web worker. Add an "onmessage" event listener to the web worker.</p>
<pre>
w.onmessage = function(event){
  document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = event.data;
}; 
</pre>

<p>When the web worker posts a message, the code within the event listener is executed. 
    The data from the web worker is stored in event.data.</p>

<h3>Terminate a Web Server</h3>
<p>When a web worker object is created, it will continue to listen for messages (even 
    after the external script is finished) until it is terminated.</p>
<p>To terminate a web worker, and free browser/computer resources, use the terminate() method:</p>
<pre>w.terminate();</pre>

<h3>Reuse the Web Worker</h3>
<p>If you set the worker variable to undefined, after it has been terminated, you can reuse the code:</p>
<pre>w = undefined;</pre>

<h3>Web Workers and the DOM</h3>
<p>Since web workers are in external files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The window object</li>
  <li>The document object</li>
  <li>The parent object</li>
</ul>
