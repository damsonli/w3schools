        <h3>The Difference Between &lt;article&gt; &lt;section&gt; and &lt;div&gt;</h3>
        <p>There is a confusing (lack of) difference in the HTML5 standard, between &lt;article&gt; &lt;section&gt; and &lt;div&gt;.</p>
        <p>In the HTML5 standard, the &lt;section&gt; element is defined as a block of related elements.</p>
        <p>The &lt;article&gt; element is defined as a complete, self-contained block of related elements.</p>
        <p>The &lt;div&gt; element is defined as a block of children elements.</p>
        <p>How to interpret that?</p>
        <p>we could use &lt;section&gt; as a container for related &lt;articles&gt;.</p>
        <p>We could also use &lt;article&gt; as a container for articles as well.&gt;</p>
