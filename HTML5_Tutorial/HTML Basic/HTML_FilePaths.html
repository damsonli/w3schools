        <h2>An absolute file path is the full URL to an internet file:</h2>
        <p>&lt;img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"&gt;</p>

        <h2>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In this example the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:</p>
                <p>&lt;img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"&gt;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In this example the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:</p>
                <p>&lt;img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"&gt;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In this example the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level above the current folder:</p>
                <p>&lt;img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"&gt;</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>It is a best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).</strong>
