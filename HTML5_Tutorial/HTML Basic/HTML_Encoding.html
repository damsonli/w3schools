        <p>ASCII was the first <b>character encoding standard</b>. It defines 128 different characters.</p>
        <p>ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set, with support for 256 different character codes.</p>
        <p>ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set also supported 256 different character codes.</p>
        <p>Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, HTML 4 also supported UTF-8, 
            which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.</p>
        <p>The default character encoding for <b>HTML 5</b> is UTF-8.</p>

        <p>To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.</p>
        <p>This is specified in the &lt;meta&gt; tag:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>HTML 4</li>
            <p>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1"&gt;</p>
            <li>HTML 5</li>
            <p>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</p>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2>The ASCII Character Set</h2>
        <p>ASCII uses the values from 0 to 31 (and 127) for control characters.</p>
        <p>ASCII uses the values from 32 to 126 for letters, digits, and symbols.</p>
        <p>ASCII does not use the values from 128 to 255.</p>

        <h2>The ANSI Character Set (Windows-1252)</h2>
        <p>ANSI is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.</p>
        <p>ANSI has a proprietary set of characters for the values from 128 to 159.</p>                
        <p>ANSI is identical to UTF-8 for the values from 160 to 255.</p>

        <h2>The ISO-8859-1 Character Set</h2>
        <p>8859-1 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.</p>
        <p>8859-1 does not use the values from 128 to 159.</p>
        <p>8859-1 is identical to UTF-8 for the values from 160 to 255.</p>

        <h2>The UTF-8 Character Set</h2>
        <p>UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.</p>
        <p>UTF-8 does not use the values from 128 to 159.</p>
        <p>UTF-8 is identical to both ANSI and 8859-1 for the values from 160 to 255.</p>
        <p>UTF-8 continues from the value 256 with more than 10 000 different characters.</p>
